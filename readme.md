Requirements
------------

- Web Project for Nette 3.1 requires PHP >= 7.4
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com))


Installation
------------

The best way to install Web Project is using Composer. If you don't have Composer yet,
download it following [the instructions](https://doc.nette.org/composer). Then use command:

	composer create-project fcapobianchi/web-project-5 path/to/install
	cd path/to/install
	composer update
	npm install
	npm start


Make directories `temp/` and `log/` writable.
Comment .gitignore www/assets/bootstrap-italia

Web Server Setup
----------------

The simplest way to get started is to start the built-in PHP server in the root directory of your project:

	php -S localhost:8000 -t www

Then visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser to see the welcome page.

For Apache or Nginx, setup a virtual host to point to the `www/` directory of the project and you
should be ready to go.

**It is CRITICAL that whole `app/`, `config/`, `log/` and `temp/` directories are not accessible directly
via a web browser. See [security warning](https://nette.org/security-warning).**
